My new Letscom headphones arrived today, but I thought they arrived dead, as the power button wouldn't turn them on. I found out the next day that the power button has to be held down for 2+ seconds to turn them on or off, so they likely arrived with half battery, like most devices do.

I charged them today, it took less than 2 hours for them to fully charge, as indicated by the charge wireless battery stopped charging them after less than 2 hours.

My new Letscom headphones arrived yesterday, but they were completely dead (I thought) If the pair of headphones actually live up to what is advertised, it will be an incredibly great investment of just $20.00.

My new letscom headphones are my first functional pair of wireless headphones (my last pair was unable to play 8 bit or better audio, so I stopped using them) 

These headphones were advertised to have a 100 hour battery. As such, I did not charge them tonight. I intend to run them dead over the course of up to 1 week to see how long they actually last.

It is so nice to have bluetooth headphones. I now can get up from my desk and walk around without my headphones getting ripped out or pulling my laptop off the desk.

I started using my headphones today near 1:00 pm. I had to read the manual for them, as I was having difficulty finding the correct device. I had to experiment with the power to get them to turn on, as I wasn't expecting a near hard power cycle motion being required to turn them on.

I also got to use headphones with my Samsung Galaxy S7 edge, something I haven't been able to do in over a year due to a broken headphone jack. With this, I noticed 2 flaws, of which I could only alleviate 1. I was able to alleviate the volume control bar coming up upon every sound effect by turning system sound off (notification sound) but I wasn't able to alleviate a 1 second audio delay. This hadn't occurred on my laptop.

I used my headphones a little bit before bed. In total, I used my headphones for over 6 hours today.

I continued to use my headphones today. They are still really nice. I learned that it is possible to wear headphones backwards today. I originally thought you could wear them any way you wanted. I used my headphones for a total of over 16 hours. The quality isn't as good as the Bose headphones I tried for a few days beforehand, but the quality is still pretty good. When I bought these, I chose between a 30 hour battery pair ($55.00) with noise canceling and a 100 hour battery pair with no noise canceling ($20.00)

I stopped using my headphones for nighttime mobile gaming, as I couldn't balance the music and the ads on Tiny Tower. It was tedious to turn the volume up after every ad and turn it down before every ad. Also, it would pop up every time I took a screenshot during Jewels gameplay. I still intend to try and play Minecraft with headphones at some point.

I continued to use my headphones again today. They have lasted a very long time. Today is my last usage day of the month. They have lasted very well so far. I am still continuing the 100 hour test. So far, the headphones have been used for over 30 hours without charging.
