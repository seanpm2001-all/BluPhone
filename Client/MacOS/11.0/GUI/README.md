# Notice

The first versions of the MacOS 11.0 GUI port are poorly translated. I did it in a bit of a rush, and I don't know very much about Swift compared to Python, so a lot of things are not formatted correctly and were rushed. Some things include:

* 1. Trying to figure out how to properly output console data in Swift (also not knowing how to create multi-line comments)

* 2. The name and extension of Python being used in place of Swift

* 3. Dates not being updated and using the same dates as the prior Python versions

* 4. Not knowing how to ask for input in Swift

* 5. The line count not being accurate in several files

I hope to stamp these issues out in version 2 or version 3.
