# Notice

The first versions of the Windows 10 GUI port are poorly translated. I did it in a bit of a rush, so there are a couple of things are not formatted correctly and were rushed. Some things include:

* 1. Dates not being updated and using the same dates as the prior Python versions

* 2. The line count not being accurate in several files

I hope to stamp these issues out in version 2 or version 3.
