# November 1st 2020

Today is the first day of November with headphones usage. The battery seems to be living up to its expectations, and it is still really enjoyable. I have gotten used to it at this point, the only problem I am having is possible severe battery drain from a consistent Bluetooth connection.

# November 2nd 2020

I continued to use my headphones normally today. I did not use it wiht my phone again. Usage has pretty much become normal.

I have been noticing another consistent problem where when I have anything paused for more than 3 seconds, upon resuming, the video will be all stuttering for 10 seconds, unless I go back 5/10 seconds (5 seconds: YT, 10 seconds: VLC) also, my headphones completely screwed up all video playback this morning, videos weren't capable of playing until I disconnected and re-connected the headphones. These issues are tolerable.

# November 3rd 2020

I continued to use my headphones normally today. Tonight, I decided to plug in my headphones and stop the 100 hour test, skipping out on another ~40 hours of testing. They have lasted an incredibly long time.

I intend to play Minecraft with the headphones tomorrow.

# November 4th 2020

I continued to use my headphones today. Today was the first day of usage after a second full charge. I intend on playing Minecraft with the headphones tonight, as I never really took the time to enjoy the game with headphones before.

I didn't plug my headphones in tonight, I intend on charging them once a week, even though they would still last more than 3 days longer. I want to keep it consistent.
